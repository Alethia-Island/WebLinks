* Be cautious of accepting unexpected gifts or group invitations whilst at a sandbox.
* We are a homestead region. Please be mindful of this when running intensive activities.
* Excessively [scripted](./sandbox/objects/scripting/limits) avatars will be asked to reduce their [scripts](./sandbox/objects/scripting/limits) or may be removed automatically.
* [Self-service object return](./sandbox/objects/return) is available from the main landing point and sky platforms.
* [Having problems?](./sandbox/help/help-points) Shout “/911 admin” or click any of the help signs located around the region.
* Landmark not working? Please use the teleporter system to reach your destination.
* [Need privacy?](./sandbox/areas/privacy) Try out our public privacy areas, accessible from the teleporters.
* The [privacy areas](./sandbox/areas/privacy) enforce a 30m height limit. You will be automatically ejected for going above this height.
* No-script areas can be found next the [privacy areas](./sandbox/areas/privacy). Look for the orange zone markers.
