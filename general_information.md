To help us maintain a pleasant and welcoming environment, we kindly ask residents to also acknowledge the [rules](./sandbox/rules) and guidelines of the sim.

* Be cautious of accepting "free gifts" and group invitations whilst at our sandbox. These are not services operated by Alethia Management.

* Alethia Island is a homestead region and has 1/4 of the resources of a full region. Please be mindful of this when running heavy or intensive tasks!

* If your landmark isn't working properly, please try using the teleport pads to get to your destination.

* Having problems? Shout "**/911 admin**" or click any of the [help points](./sandbox/help/help-points) around the sandbox. Alternatively, please contact an owner.

* This sand box runs an 8 hour auto-return. The timer starts from when you rez an object.

* Excessively scripted avatars will be asked by our script counters to reduce their scripts. Failure to do so will result in an automatic ejection.

* Excessively idle avatars may be removed to ease congestion during very busy periods.

* Need some privacy away from other people? There are [privacy-enabled areas](./sandbox/areas/privacy) located just next to the landing point.

* The sandbox is always open except during special events when we may choose to restrict access. A notice will be always be sent beforehand.
