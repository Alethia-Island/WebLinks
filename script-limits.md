Alethia Island operates a script limit to help maintain a smooth and enjoyable experience at the sandbox. Exceeding the limit for an extended period of time will result in automatic ejection.

The script counter can be found next to our main landing point and represents the overall impact of all users in the sim.

Our current script impact limits are:

* 16 MiB Maximum Memory
* 0.750ms Maximum CPU Time
