Alethia Island operates a self-service object return system to help you retrieve lost items from the sandbox. These terminals can be located all around the sandbox and on each of the sky platforms.

Please note that the system only returns objects from the main sandbox parcel and not from the no-script or privacy areas. [Please ask](./contact) if you need assistance with finding or clearing your objects.
