## SANDBOX RULES
- Respect the sim, staff, and other users of the sandbox.
- No sex / adult roleplay.
- No child avatars.
- No begging, selling, spam, recruitment or unwanted advertising.
- There is a fair-use 200 LI (Land Impact) limit when we are busy. Please ask if you need a consideration to be made.
- Please do not restrict access to the sandbox services. (Teleporters, stores, privacy areas etc.)
- Please take or delete your items! We operate a self-service object return system that can assist with this.
- Please keep projectiles and weapons in the designated testing areas. Avoid using items that cause problems for the region or users.

## General Information
- To help us maintain a pleasant and welcoming environment, we kindly ask residents to also acknowledge the rules and guidelines of the sim.
- Be cautious of accepting "free gifts" and group invitations whilst at our sandbox. These are not services operated by Alethia Management.
- Alethia Island is a homestead region and has 1/4 of the resources of a full region. Please be mindful of this when running heavy or intensive tasks!
- If your landmark isn't working properly, please try using the teleport pads to get to your destination.
- Having problems? Shout "/911 admin" or click any of the help points around the sandbox. Alternatively, please contact an owner.
- This sand box runs an 8 hour auto-return. The timer starts from when you rez an object.
- Excessively scripted avatars will be asked by our script counters to reduce their scripts. Failure to do so will result in an automatic ejection.
- Excessively idle avatars may be removed to ease congestion during very busy periods.
- Need some privacy away from other people? There are privacy-enabled areas located just next to the landing point.
- The sandbox is always open except during special events when we may choose to restrict access. A notice will be always be sent beforehand.
